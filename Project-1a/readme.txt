This php calculator is written by John Kim and Tianyan Wu. We tried to make our calculator works as similar to the demo calculator as possible. Possible cases we handled include when you have input that does not contain operators or numbers or dot. Also if the input has invalid floating point form, such as 2., .23, 2.3.4, they are all taken care as invalid inputs. Divide by zero is also handled.
